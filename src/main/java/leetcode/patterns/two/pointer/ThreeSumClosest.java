//16. 3Sum Closest
//Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
//
//Return the sum of the three integers.
//
//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
//Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
//Output: 2
//Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
//Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
//Output: 0
//Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
